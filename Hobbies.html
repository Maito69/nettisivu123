            <p>Outside of my academic and professional life, I have a broad range of interests. I am passionate about video games and fashion, I enjoy upcycling and DIY clothing projects. I also have a strong love for travel, having visited 18 different countries. Since childhood, I have been involved in various forms of handcrafts and art, inspired by my mother, who is an artist. In terms of physical activities, I practiced Tai Chi for several years and have also tried yoga, though I found it was not to my liking. I enjoy playing music and can play the ukulele and guitar, with additional experience with the recorder, piano, and handpan, although I donâ€™t play them regularly. I also have a keen interest in photography and enjoy capturing and editing images in my spare time.</p>
